PROJECT COUNTER APP (JAVASCRIPT BASIC)

This project as the screenshot shows is a simple Counter encoded with:

HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT

The starting value, set to 0, will increase or decrease according to your click on the PLUS and MINUS buttons.

There is also a RESET button, which will return the initial value 0 when clicked.

This was my first direct approach with JAVASCRIPT and I hope with its sharing can help those like me who have just entered his fantastic world.

I am attaching the link where you can try and use the application:
